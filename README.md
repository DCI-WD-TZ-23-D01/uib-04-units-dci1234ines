# CSS units

This is a series of small exercises to practice units in CSS. Create `index.html` and `main.css` for your code and include the basic HTML5 boilerplate to start.

## Tasks

### Task 1

Create a first level heading where the font size is `20%` of the viewport width. Set the height to `100%` of the viewport height. Add just enough content that the text fits on one line.

Try resizing the window and observe the effect of the change.

### Task 2

Create a pink `section` element and set its width to `50%` of the width of its parents content area. Inside, create three paragraphs with a simple `lorem25` (use emmet!) content:

- Set the font size of the first paragraph to `18px`
- Set the font size of the second to `3%` of the width of the viewport
- Set the font size of the third to `5%` of the height of the viewport

Try resizing the window and observe the effect of the change.

### Task 3

Create a lightblue `section` element and set its font size to `32px`, don't define a special width. Inside, create three paragraphs with a simple `lorem25` (use emmet!) content:

- Set the font size of the first to `18px`
- Set the font size of the second to `100%` of the font size of the parent
- Set the font size of the third to `100%` of the font size of root element

### Task 4

Create an orange box with a width equal to `80%` of the viewport width and a height equal to `50%` of the viewport height.
